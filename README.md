# TurboID_analysis
A package that contains functions to create the ROC curves from Cho et al., 2020 (Nat Protoc). It calculates TPR and FPR based on user-provided true- and false-positive lists, as well as the provided dataset with protein measurements. A previously calculated ratio of the protein measurements (sample/biotin control) is required.
